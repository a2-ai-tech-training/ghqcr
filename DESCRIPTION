Description: GHQC is a set of rust powered shiny apps that utilize GitHub Issues as the hub of the QC process.
    Each file assigned for QC, using the Assign App, becomes its own Issue within a Milestone. 
    Reviewers and Authors can then notify changes and reviews, using the Notify App, and approve once the file is finished.
    The history of the QC can then be recorded into a PDF using the Record App.
